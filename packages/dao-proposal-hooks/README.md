# CosmWasm DAO Proposal Hooks

This package provides an interface for managing and dispatching
proposal hooks from a proposal module.

There are two types of proposal hooks:
- **New Proposal Hook:** fired when a new proposal is created.
- **Proposal Staus Changed Hook:** fired when a proposal's status changes.
