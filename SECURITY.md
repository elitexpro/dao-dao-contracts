If you find a security vulnerability in our contracts it's a very big
deal and we'd like to work with you to get it fixed. To keep the DAOs
that use DAO DAO safe, we ask that you don't mention it publicly and
get in touch with one of us.

For Discord, please DM:

- ekez#9732 (PST, often up late so may be good for Eastern European and Asian time zone mornings)
- elsehow#3115 (PST, more avaliable than ekez in PST mornings)
- Callum#5521 (UTC)

DM as many of us as you need to get a response.

If you're concerned about Discord's phone number requirements feel
free to email a report to ekez at `ekez@withoutdoing.com`. That email
uses [gsuite](https://workspace.google.com/); if you're worried about
Google you can use this public key:
