[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=SCKOIPYZPV)](https://codecov.io/gh/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts)

This is a collection of smart contracts for building composable,
modular, and upgradable DAOs.

For an overview of our contract design, see [our
wiki](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/wiki/DAO-DAO-Contracts-Design).
